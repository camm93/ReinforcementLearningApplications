# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of reinforcement learning (RL) agents for solving various environments. Each project applies RL techniques like Value Iteration, SARSA, Q-Learning or other algorithms to train agents that learn through interaction with their environments.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 🎲 Modified Snakes and Ladders Agent
An agent is trained using Q-Learning to navigate a modified version of the Snakes and Ladders board game. The board includes traps, ladders, and victory cells, and the agent learns an optimal policy to reach the goal while avoiding penalties.
